# **Password Juicer/Generator**
## Created by: me(Jaden) AKA BIG JUICE
### Let's Go!!!! 

Here lies my personalized password generator! 
I wanted the theme to be appealing and a dark intriguing color so why not purple. My application here applies my basic newfound understanding of Javascript combined with some of my HTML & CSS knowledge. It's going to be a quick one stop website so why not make it look FUN. 

Instructions are simple just load up the deployed application by clicking on its link. Then you are presented with a button reading "Juice me a password" so you go ahead and click the button as that's what they're made to do. THEN BOOM! A nice modal interface pops up with experimental neon back lighting. More importantly, the options to select what specifically you want in your password the 4 options are:

- Lowercase letters
- Uppercase letters
- Including numbers
- Including special characters

Once you've checked the options you desire go ahead and click "All Done!".
Then a glorious randomly-generated password is now at your disposal.
Making it a quick and efficient pit stop.
